          CKAN 2.8 is not compatible with SQLAlchemy 1.2 but it will be fixed: https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/5796#issuecomment-758844107.
          CKAN 2.9 is already using a safe SQLAlchemy version. 
          We examined all use of 'group_by' and 'order_by'
          and determine that all input to those operators are sanitized.
          Also, an email was sent to CKAN core team to cover this in next CKAN releases

  SNYK-PYTHON-IPADDRESS-590065:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet.  After inspecting the
          Python cryptography package, I see no use of the vulnerable
          method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface, 
          so the risk here is very minimal.

        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet.  After inspecting the
          vulnerability, ipaddresses are only provided from trusted
          sources, so the risk is minimal.

          Cannot upgrade to 0.4 at this time, requires py3.
          SQL is sanitized/written by trusted sources, so risk
          is minimal.
