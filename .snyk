          CKAN 2.8 is not compatible with SQLAlchemy 1.2 but it will be fixed: https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/5796#issuecomment-758844107.
          CKAN 2.9 is already using a safe SQLAlchemy version. 
          We examined all use of 'group_by' and 'order_by'
          and determine that all input to those operators are sanitized.
          Also, an email was sent to CKAN core team to cover this in next CKAN releases

  SNYK-PYTHON-IPADDRESS-590065:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet.  After inspecting the
          Python cryptography package, I see no use of the vulnerable
          method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface, 
          so the risk here is very minimal.

  SNYK-PYTHON-CRYPTOGRAPHY-1022152:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Patched to version 3.2; long term fix expected later.
          Version 3.2 of this package contains an incomplete fix,
          which might help reduce the chances of this vulnerability 
          being exploited.
