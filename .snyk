          CKAN 2.8 is not compatible with SQLAlchemy 1.3 but it will be fixed: https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/5796#issuecomment-758844107.
          CKAN 2.9 require an upate from 1.3.5 to 1.3.19. 
          We examined all use of 'group_by' and 'order_by'
          and determine that all input to those operators are sanitized.
          Also, an email was sent to CKAN core team to cover this in next CKAN releases

          Risk is acceptable.

          CKAN 2.8 is not compatible with SQLAlchemy 1.2 but it will be fixed: https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/5796#issuecomment-758844107.
          CKAN 2.9 is already using a safe SQLAlchemy version. 
          We examined all use of 'group_by' and 'order_by'
          and determine that all input to those operators are sanitized.

          Fix is created but not yet published.
          Risk appears to be very low.  The vulnerability is in the passlib
          bcrypt() implementation, and CKAN (2.8) uses pbkdf2.  In addition,
          in production environments we use a SAML provider for auth.

  SNYK-PYTHON-IPADDRESS-590065:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          No remediation available yet.  After inspecting the
          Python cryptography package, I see no use of the vulnerable
          method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface, 
          so the risk here is very minimal.

          Patched to version 3.2; long term fix expected later.
          Version 3.2 of this package contains an incomplete fix,
          which might help reduce the chances of this vulnerability 
          being exploited.
